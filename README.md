This project is the first project in Odin's curriculum and serves as a means to get situated with HTML and its syntax.
The purpose of this project is to build a functioning webpage that efficiently and effectively displays recipes of dishes that have been selected by myself, as well as the corresponding information that goes along with those recipes (such as images).
